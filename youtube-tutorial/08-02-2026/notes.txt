1) rust variables are immutable by default. we can change it to mutable.

example:
	let two = 2;
	let hello = "Hello";
	let j = 'j';
	let half = 0.5;
	let mut my_name = "bill"; //can change the value later because it is mutable 
	let another_half = half; 


2)functions

example:
	fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
		a + b;
	}

fn -> keyword
add -> name of the function
a, b -> variables
i32 -> datatype it means 32 bit integer variable

-> i32 -> return 32 bit integer variable 

to call this function:
	let x = add(1, 1);


3) macros

macros expands into additional code.
name followd by ! means it is a macro
